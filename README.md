# üì¶ Terraform S3 Inventory Configuration Module

This Terraform module automates the process of **identifying all S3 buckets in a specified AWS region** and **applying an Inventory configuration** (`terra-s3-inv`) to each bucket that doesn't already have it.

---

## üöÄ Purpose

The goal of this module is to provide **visibility and governance** across your S3 assets by:

- üîç **Discovering** all S3 buckets that exist in a specific region
- üì• **Generating a CSV report** of those buckets
- üìÇ **Uploading the report** as a GitHub Actions artifact
- ‚úÖ **Checking each bucket** for an existing inventory configuration named `terra-s3-inv`
- üèóÔ∏è **Creating the inventory configuration** if it's missing
- üì§ **Delivering inventory reports** to a central destination bucket (`s3-terra-inventory`)

This is especially useful for compliance, cost tracking, and operational transparency.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Local Execution with `null_resource`**:
   - Uses a `local-exec` provisioner to run AWS CLI commands inside Terraform.
   - Filters buckets to include only those within the specified region.

2. **CSV Output**:
   - Writes the filtered bucket names into a `buckets.csv` file.

3. **Inventory Configuration Check**:
   - For each matching bucket, checks if `terra-s3-inv` inventory exists.
   - If not found, a new configuration is added using `aws s3api put-bucket-inventory-configuration`.

4. **Cross-Bucket Reporting**:
   - Inventory data is stored in a central bucket (`s3-terra-inventory`) for easier aggregation.

## üìé Requirements

- Terraform >= 1.3.0
- AWS CLI installed (for local-exec commands)
- IAM permissions to list and configure S3 buckets
- Destination bucket (`s3-terra-inventory`) must already exist

---

## üìÅ Outputs

- `buckets.csv` file with all S3 buckets in the selected region
- GitHub Actions artifact for further audit or CI/CD integrations
